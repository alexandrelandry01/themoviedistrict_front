            TheMovieDistrict is a project that initially developped in September of 2013.

            As a cinephile, who always had a fascination for time and evolution of a given environment, I started out by
            trying to locate specific movie locations from movies I loved, using all sorts of hints I could find -- both
            on-screen and off the Internet.
        </p>

            Eventually, TheMovieDistrict was born.

            This site is basically a sandbox where I get to document my latest findings. 
            Hope you appreciate it.
